**Introduction**

With current (2023-2024) interest rates standing at 22 year highs, the Federal Reserve's (Fed's) decisons to hold interest rates "higher for longer" or to pivot downwards has gained great scrutiny from analysts and the general public.
As such, a tool that can allow stakeholders to identify main topics about the economic outlook as discussed by the FOMC in their meetings would provide considerable time savings and reduce subjective biases from these stakeholders reading through the wordy minutes themselves.

**Dataset**

The dataset comprises of 121 FOMC meeting minutes documents spanning 15 years from 2009 to 2024.
Specifically, only the "Staff Economic Outlook" section has been identified and extracted for topic modelling purposes.

**Approach**

*The corpus was first pre-processed and tokenized using the NLTK library
